## HOME SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM 

The main idea of this project consists of the movement of sound waves. The working principle of
the ultrasonic sensor used in the alarm system is to measure the distance using sound waves. By
using this principle, it will be possible to understand whether there is an object nearby, that is,
whether the alarm is active. The project has ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, keypad and LCD display
and a simple program usage. The sensor detects the motion and processes the signal, so it sends
the signal to the Arduino that started the alarm. .In this way, we can safely sit at home with the
alarm system we set up without paying high costs and making use of sound waves.
